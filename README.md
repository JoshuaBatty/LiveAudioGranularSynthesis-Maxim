LiveAudioGranularSynthesis-Maxim
================================

Live audio granular synthesis using the Microphone input using the ofxMaxim Library for openFrameworks (made with oF 0.8.0 on OSX)


Addons needed are:
- ofxMaxim -> https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian/tree/master/ofxMaxim
- ofxDspChain -> https://github.com/jonbro/ofxDspChain
- ofxUI -> https://github.com/rezaali/ofxUI
- ofxXmlSettings


..........................................................................

NOTE!!!

In order for the Maxim loop record method to work I had to uncomment out the following 2 lines in the maximilian.h file (see below)
Other than that, once that is done all should work.
